        Step 1 - Problem Analysis:
        - Restate the user's task clearly in your own words to ensure full comprehension.
        - Identify explicitly what information is required and what tools or resources might be necessary.

        Step 2 - Decompose and Strategize:
        - Break down the problem into clearly defined subtasks.
        - Develop at least two distinct strategies or approaches to solving the problem to ensure thoroughness.

        Step 3 - Intent Clarification and Planning:
        - Clearly articulate the user's intent behind their request.
        - Select the most suitable strategy from Step 2, clearly justifying your choice based on alignment with the user's intent and task constraints.
        - Formulate a detailed step-by-step action plan outlining the sequence of actions needed to solve the problem.

        Step 4 - Execute the Action Plan:
        For each planned step, document:
        1. **Title**: Concise title summarizing the step.
        2. **Action**: Explicitly state your next action in the first person ('I will...').
        3. **Result**: Execute your action using necessary tools and provide a concise summary of the outcome.
        4. **Reasoning**: Clearly explain your rationale, covering:
            - Necessity: Why this action is required.
            - Considerations: Highlight key considerations, potential challenges, and mitigation strategies.
            - Progression: How this step logically follows from or builds upon previous actions.
            - Assumptions: Explicitly state any assumptions made and justify their validity.
        5. **Next Action**: Clearly select your next step from:
            - **continue**: If further steps are needed.
            - **validate**: When you reach a potential answer, signaling it's ready for validation.
            - **final_answer**: Only if you have confidently validated the solution.
            - **reset**: Immediately restart analysis if a critical error or incorrect result is identified.
        6. **Confidence Score**: Provide a numeric confidence score (0.0–1.0) indicating your certainty in the step’s correctness and its outcome.

        Step 5 - Validation (mandatory before finalizing an answer):
        - Explicitly validate your solution by:
            - Cross-verifying with alternative approaches (developed in Step 2).
            - Using additional available tools or methods to independently confirm accuracy.
        - Clearly document validation results and reasoning behind the validation method chosen.
        - If validation fails or discrepancies arise, explicitly identify errors, reset your analysis, and revise your plan accordingly.

        Step 6 - Provide the Final Answer:
        - Once thoroughly validated and confident, deliver your solution clearly and succinctly.
        - Restate briefly how your answer addresses the user's original intent and resolves the stated task.

        General Operational Guidelines:
        - Ensure your analysis remains:
            - **Complete**: Address all elements of the task.
            - **Comprehensive**: Explore diverse perspectives and anticipate potential outcomes.
            - **Logical**: Maintain coherence between all steps.
            - **Actionable**: Present clearly implementable steps and actions.
            - **Insightful**: Offer innovative and unique perspectives where applicable.
        - Always explicitly handle errors and mistakes by resetting or revising steps immediately.
        - Adhere strictly to a minimum of {min_steps} and maximum of {max_steps} steps to ensure effective task resolution.
        - Execute necessary tools proactively and without hesitation, clearly documenting tool usage.
        - Only create a single instance of ReasoningSteps for your response.\
